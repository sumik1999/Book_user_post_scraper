#### There are two different scripts for two different tasks.

1. The first script creates users from an api and to fetches the posts for each user. I have used mongo db as the database here. Please ensure that mongo db is installed in the system.
2. The second script scrapes book-details from a website and populate that in the database and i have used sqlite database for this.
